## Overview

We are creating an application to track movies.

* Studios have a name and location
  * ex: name: 'Universal Studios', location: 'Hollywood'
* Movies have a title, creation year, and genre
  * ex: title: 'Toy Story', creation_year: '1995', genre: 'animation'
* Actors have a name and age
  * ex: name: 'Meryl Streep', age: 73
* Studios have many movies
* Movies belong to a studio
* Movies have many actors
* Actors can be in many movies

You will need to create all the migrations.

## User Stories

Story 1
Studio Index

As a user,
When I visit the studio index page,
Then I see all of the studios including name and location,
And under each studio I see all of the studio's movies
including the movie's title, creation year, and genre
```

```
Story 2
Movie Show

As a user,
When I visit a movie's show page.
I see the movie's title, creation year, and genre,
and a list of all its actors from youngest to oldest.
And I see the average age of all of the movie's actors
```

```
Story 3
Add an Actor to a Movie

As a user,
When I visit a movie show page,
I do not see any actors listed that are not part of the movie
And I see a form to add an actor to this movie
When I fill in the form with the ID of an actor that exists in the database
And I click submit
Then I am redirected back to that movie's show page
And I see the actor's name is now listed
(You do not have to test for a sad path, for example if the id submitted is not an existing actor)
```

## Extension

```
Extension
Studio's Actors

As a user,
When I visit a studio's show page
